# Projects

A collection of projects to learn and hold several frameworks in one place while also learning about Nx / monorepos

- APIs
  - [x] Express
  - [ ] Nest
- Frontend
  - [ ] React
  - [ ] Svelte
- ORM
  - [x] Prisma

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

- If you have nx installed globally remove npx prefix

```sh
npx nx serve <api-name>
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build <project-name>
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
